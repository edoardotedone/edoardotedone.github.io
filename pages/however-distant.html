          What Comes After Will Not Be Like What Came Before<br>
          An exhibition by The Critical Inquiry Lab<br>
          @Temporary Art Centre<br>
          Eindhoven<br><br>

          For four days my graduation project was exhibited alongside those of my classmates in the exhibition
          “What Comes After Will Not Be Like What Came Before” at TAC Eindhoven.<br><br>

          Here's some extracts from the exhibition text: <br><br>
            
          (A) In Europe, particularly in France, rap music videos set in urban peripheries display a homogeneous corpus of images, supporting the formation
          of a contiguous body of practices, focusing on self-affirmation and territorial de-stigmatisation. <br>
          Although geographically dispersed, rap culture acts in fact as a landscape for assembly - as an emancipatory platform for the community as a whole. <br>
          To shed light on the proximities and common experiences within the European rap scene, this project envisions the creation of a stage that puts together
          ‘under the same roof’ scenery from France and Italy. <br><br>
          (B) Rap-video culture expresses the disparities between urban peripheries and dominant centres. It offers audio-visual records of the living
          conditions that regulate and reinforce the ambitions and fears of many who live in suburban areas. To shed light on the common experiences within
          the European rap scene, However Distant envisions the creation of a stage that puts together scenery captured from French and Italian rap videos.
          Despite their geographical distance, the videos recall the formation of a contiguous body of practices, focusing on self-affirmation and territorial
          de-stigmatisation. Drone and aerial shots depict rappers immersed in the architectural elements of their neighbourhoods – an act of defiance and resistance
          to marginalisation and disenfranchisement. <br><br>
