          <h1>BREAK THE CYCLE: On Rap Video Culture, Les Grand Ensemble & Self<wbr>Representation</h1><br>
          The city, as the cradle of civilization, has been recounted by an infinite number of authors throughout history, however, for centuries we knew little about it
           from non-institutional and peripheral perspectives. Indeed, only ‘recently’, the urban periphery has found ways to convey its stories, occupying and making use of numerous
            arenas.<br>
              This short essay analyzes and discusses how rap video culture has given voice to urban outcasts, and helped them portray their surroundings in a different array of styles;
           highlighting the formation of a shared sensibility, and the rising potential hiding behind a visual register widely used within the French context. On the other hand, it will
            analyse the limits of canonical rap imageries and restraining narrative schemes, in order to contribute to the implementation of sustainable practices within the genre.<br><br>
          The dissertation incorporates several music videos, uploaded on YouTube since 2006, and covering a period of time spanning from 1982 to 2020. In addition, parallel to a short
           historical and contextual introduction to the genre, as well as to the French urban periphery, the text will make use of the analysis of several sociologists, theorists, and
            artists in order to substantiate the critique of the aforementioned visual material.<br>
              Last but not least, particular attention will be given to the French context, due to the abundance of documentation and emerging platforms discussing the state of affairs
           of both rap video culture and urban peripheries; yet I believe that the following analysis can be extended, with due proportion and additional research, to several other
            countries within Europe, such as  the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy.<br><br>
          <p style="text-align: center;">-----------------</p><br>
          Henri Lefebvre point-blank begins his 1970 book The Urban Revolution as follows:<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>I'll begin with the following hypothesis: Society has been completely urbanized. This hypothesis implies a definition: an urban society is a society
             that results from a process of complete urbanization. This urbanization is virtual today but will become real in the future.
              <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Henri Lefebvre, The Urban Revolution, University of Minnesota Press, 1970, 2003, p. 1."><sup>1</sup></span>
               (Lefebvre, 1970)</em></p><br>
          Fifty years later, this is still not the case, however, most of the analysis discussed by Lefebvre in The Urban Revolution seems to be more than ever palpable today.
           Especially those concerning the aftermath of urbanization, where attention is drawn to the urban problematic and the intensification of violence
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="ibid., p. 108."><sup>2</sup></span>,
             especially from a global perspective.<br>
              Although critiquing urbanization at all scales,however, Lefebvre's analysis often evokes, by way of example, the French urban society, as well as Paris, the city par
           excellence in relation to the combination of urban planning, understood as a grand design for the constitution of a new order, and its repercussion on urban communities.<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>[Georges-Eugène Haussmann] gutted Paris according to plan, deported the proletariat to the periphery [..] cutting through the urban fabric,
             and inscribing straight lines throughout the city [...] a logic that is inherent in class strategy and tends to maximize this type of rational coherence, which originated
              with Napoleon I and the absolute state. 
              <span class="hovertext" data-hover="ibid., p. 109."><sup>3</sup></span>
               (Lefebvre, 1970)</em></p><br>

          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="“The great cross”: Haussmann's renovation of Paris featured two large avenues forming a cross .ibid., p. 113."><sup>4</sup></span>
           however, isn’t an isolated historical event at all, and going back in time, Lefevbre inscribes it within a tradition and rationality long-tied
             to dominant ideologies, Bonapartism in this case; a stillicide perpetuated across various regions and times, not just linked to the city, as a defined geographic entity,
              but instead – acknowledging the scale and complexity of urbanization processes – to the urban, a much more porous and polymorphic organism; leading to what Levebvre defines
               as an overall colonization of space that sees no boundary dividing cities or countries, but cutting across the urban, between a dominated periphery and a dominating center
                <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Loïc Wacquant, Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2008), 245."><sup>5</sup></span>.<br>
              The urban society, as formulated by Lefebvre, sees in fact, the formation of two major dichotomies: the rural-urban and the center-periphery.
           A clash between different geographies, running at different speeds, and defined by different logics, but still belonging to the same overarching system,
            state, or economy.<br><br>
          On the same matter 39 years later, Metahaven, questioning the state of affairs of the Pan-European identity draws attention to the expansion of advanced forms of
           marginality within the EU.<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>The French banlieues have developed something the sociologist Loïc Wacquant calls “advanced marginality” 
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Loïc Wacquant, Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2008), 245."><sup>6</sup></span>,
             a tremendously powerful condition with regard to the condition of border, or periphery. [...]
             Revamped (historical) city centers, meticulously styled and kept, become "global destinations'' for capital, culture, and investment, while cheaply and quickly
              constructed urban peripheries become ever poorer, harder to reach, and more difficult to leave. 
              <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Metahaven, Europe Sans: History, Politics, and Protocol in the EU Image, e-flux, Journal #05 - April 2009."><sup>7</sup></span>
               Center-periphery oppositions like these are increasingly found as borders within Europe. According to the French thinker Étienne Balibar,
                there are “modes of inclusion and exclusion in the European sphere.” 
               <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Étienne Balibar, We, the People of Europe? Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, trans. James Swenson (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004), 3"><sup>8</sup></span>.
                Europe is a “borderland”, anything but the patchwork of peace and prosperity conforming to the EU's official brand image.

          Keeping an eye on the French context, a case in point is the ZUS 
          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="A law passed on November 14, 1996 created two area subsets, namely the ZRU (Zones de Redynamisation Urbaine) and the ZFU (Zones Franches Urbaines).

           and keep the country ‘safe’.<br> 
              Launched by the right-of-center Juppè government in 1996,the PRV is the product of a political campaign by Jacques Chirac aimed at fighting against the fracture
           sociale [social divide] and the risk of social unrest in the suburbs, that was holding hostage the State.<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>Le plan présenté aujourd'hui par Alain Juppé semble avoir choisi d'autres angles d'attaque: celui du renforcement de la présence de
             l'Etat dans les banlieues et surtout celui de l'emploi. Ainsi le pacte prévoit­il une augmentation des effectifs de police, des mesures supplémentaires contre
              la délinquance (avec la création, déjà critiquée, d'« unités à encadrement éducatif renforcé »), des dispositions en faveur du secteur éducatif ainsi que du logement.
               Afin de favoriser la mixité sociale, les règles d'attribution de HLM seraient assouplies par la suppression des plafonds de ressources et la non-application des surloyers.
                (Philippe Moreau, Les Echos, 1996)</em></p><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>The plan presented today by Alain Juppé seems to have chosen other angles of attack: that of strengthening the presence of the State
             in the suburbs and especially of employment. Thus, the pact aims to increase the police force, and additional measures against delinquency (with the creation,
              already criticized, of  juvenile detention centers.), and provisions in favor of the educational sector as well as housing. In order to promote social mix,
               the allocation rules for low-cost housing would be relaxed by removing income ceilings and rent surcharge.</em></p><br>
          Such intensive policing led to the expected results. Along with what Silverstein and Tetreault (2006) have called the “defacto militarization of housing projects”,
           the PRV is considered to have also introduced a shift in focus from solidarity between communities, to a model based on economic success with strictly defined space

Interestingly enough, the same issue is told (2:28-2:42) by Francesco Curia AKA Saga Er Secco, a rapper from Rome, in conversation about his neighborhood, Tor Bella Monaca: “It often happened to us [him and his acquaintances] to go to a job interview and being asked "Where do you live?"and then reply "Well... Torre Gaia..Torre Angela..” so as not to mention Tor Bella Monaca because we were systematically labelled because of that.” "><sup>19</sup></span>

          One of these districts is La Villeneuve 
          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Quartier Villeneuve - Village-Olympique, Grenoble, France"><sup>20</sup></span>,
           a residential neighborhood located in the south of Grenoble.  Designed and built between 1963 and 1983,
           in the 1970s it has been widely publicized as a symbol of the post-68 architecture, being one of the first attempts at creating a differentiated district integrating jobs,
            housing, and various services altogether. But as much as the buildings were quite correct and the urban space agreeable, throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
             the lack of investments, and the ongoing deterioration of the estates, combined with acute economic problems, turned this 1970s utopia into a fragile ecosystem;
              worthy of inclusion in the Zones de Redynamisation Urbaine (ZRU). A downfall predicted by French sociologists 
              <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Jean-François Augoyard was himself a resident of l'Arlequin, an housing complex within La Villeneuve.

              to reduplicate this loss of self and of “home” in the city, by closing off all prospects through the shrinking of cityscapes, economic pressure, social division,
               overpricing of “small” property lots, and the concentration of slum areas

          On the other hand, the decline of La Villeneuve, together with other neighborhoods across France, has been covered by French media manufacturing an image

             <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Loïc Wacquant, 2008, p. 144: “Demographer Herve Le Bras (1989) put Europe on guard against the 'American trap' represented by the formation of ethnic 'ghettos', which he claims is already under way in several countries of the continent.

              exacerbated the national public discourse around the social divide and social impoverishment; defectively comparing the banlieues

               which was suddenly accelerated and greatly amplified following the incidents in Vaulx-en-Velin in October 1990, variously described by the press as a riot',
                a 'revolt', an 'uprising', and even a 'veritable urban guerrilla [war]'.

            Despite the political and mediatic ostracism however, there is still who offers resistance. Stigmatizing media coverage in fact do not go unnoticed
             and often found instead the opposition of local residents accusing newspapers and broadcasters of carrying and supporting prejudicial beliefs

          In the early 1980s, when rap music began to drift away from eclosed spaces and events such as clubs and block parties 
          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="A block party is a party that is held outdoors in a street or other public place, often organized by the people living in the local area. With regards to Hip Hop culture, the term refers to parties held originally in New York, specifically in the Bronx.

           and gangsterism started taking roots in the culture, bringing a new spacial dimension in it, a new subgenre deeply tied to urban geographies established itself as
            one of the most influential styles in hip hop music: gangsta rap; a subgenre either made by or about gangsters, promoting both tales of street life
             and the lifestyle associated with it. And as much as rap music changed and evolved over the years, gangsta rap imagery and its recurring themes
              remained dominant within the rap landscape, helping to popularize the use of urban settings in rap videos, and characterizing the genre’s aptitude
               for the narration of urban realities.<br>
              Ice T, for instance, who helped pioneer gangsta rap, already in the late 1980s used to interwoven his music videos

           with images of Los Angeles, featuring both cinematic scenes worthy of a crime movie and documentary-style shots of the Californian cityscape. And similarly
            to Ice T, many other artists over the years – both in and out of the North American context – walked the same path; such as Nipsey Hussle in
             Picture Me Rollin 
             <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Nipsey Hussle, Picture Me Rollin, YouTube, uploaded by Nipsey Hussle, Dec 29, 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l339Nv1tTC0"><sup>46</sup></span>

              of their respective cities and neighborhoods.<br><br>
          But it is no coincidence that so many artists over time and across so many different countries have promoted images of their districts; as if in the face
           of a society that devalues and demeans them 
           <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Beatrice Finauro & Simon Reynolds, A Fantasy Of A Life Without Constraints, Collectible Dry, 2018."><sup>48</sup></span>
            one way in which they could have cope with 'dispossession' was through the passionate display of the districts to which they belonged, although impoverished, moche 
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="In response to an article on the 'ugliness' of the suburbs published by Télérama and titled “Comment la France est devenue moche [How France got ugly]”, Éric Chauvier wrote his 2011 book Contre Télérama [Against Télérama], disapproving the class judgment disguised as an aesthetic one issued by the journalists."><sup>49</sup></span>
             [ugly]  or dysfunctional.<br>
              Rappers, in fact, seem to respond symbiotically to the ecosystems. A concept well-argued by Jesse Mccarthy in one of his Notes on Trap:<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>TRAP 
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="'Trap' is a Hip Hop music subgenre originated in the Southern United States during the late 1990s. Despite sonically and aesthetically breaking with the past, through the inventive use of sonic elements such as 808 drum kicks and heavy-tuned vocals, its structures & subjects are still very similar to rap music produced in mid-late 1980’s, such as gangsta rap."><sup>50</sup></span>
             IS THE ONLY MUSIC that sounds like what living in contemporary America feels like. It is the soundtrack of the
             dissocialized subject that neoliberalism made. It is the funeral music that the Reagan revolution deserves. 
             <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Jesse Mccarthy, Notes on Trap: A world where everything is always dripping, Nplusonemag, Issue 32, Fall 2018."><sup>51</sup></span>
              (Jesse Mccarthy, 2018)</em></p><br>
          And despite being a comment on the American society, this concept seemingly applies to many other countries and contexts where living conditions are now majorly
           dictated by urbanization processes, as defined by Henri Lefebvre. With rap music now potentially becoming the soundtrack of the infinitude of inner borders
            fragmenting the globe; the soundtrack of policies exacerbating territorial stigmatization in France; the soundtrack of the forthcoming complete urbanization.<br>
              Indeed, rap culture today, especially through the production of visual records, assumes the task of narrating the city and its symbols, in the same way in the
           19th-century poets and novelists portrayed the rise of the city as the new totalizing ground to decipher.<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>The symbolic dimension of the city was discovered by Victor Hugo, its paradigmatic dimension by Baudelaire, and its syntagmatic
             dimension by many poets who inhabited the city and wrote about their travels: romantics and minor poets, from Gérard de Nerval to Lautrémont and Rimbaud.

                  (Lefebvre, 1970)</em></p><br>
          Likewise, rap music, better than most music genres, it has been able, and it is still able – at its best – to provide a different understanding of the urban
           context, quite often fracturing the institutional and postcard-perfect image of the city, by reframing and observing it from unconventional perspectives.<br>
              In this regard, Kodwo Eshun in a short essay entitled Abducted by Audio 
          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Kodwo Eshun, Abducted by Audio, Abstract Culture, Swarm 3, Issue 12 (1997)."><sup>53</sup></span>
           analyzes how much, already in the mid-1990s, rap music grew used to morph and unsettle reality:<br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>“So if you go back to 1992 when Cypress Hill started - if you remember, before that, you had hip hop which was very much based in an
             idea of reality, in an idea of representing your neighbourhood, representing your true class or true group around you- as soon as you had Cypress Hill you
              had that reality blending, you had reality morphing into a psychogeography, a more unreal state. The first thing you hear is the sound of inhalation, people
               breathing in, the sound of the hits from the bong. That kind of magnification, that idea of sound microscoping right in close to your ear, that’s what was
                fascinating about hip hop, and that was, immediately, when you started to realise that reality was starting to morph.” (Eshun, 1997)</em></p><br>
          An analysis to be understood not as a withdrawal of the genre, and its video culture, from its social and documentary functions, which on the contrary continued
           to play a major role, but rather as an enhancement of its subjectivity and its analytical potential.<br>
              Indeed,thanks to this shift in mindset, multiple voices coexist within the genre today, and the urban context, and all the stories associated with it,
           can be experienced in a wide range of shades; sometimes fictionalized with cinematic features; sometimes sublimated into myths and legends; sometimes
            excessively glamorized 
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="One of the core elements of trap music is the exorcization of poverty and social impoverishment through the use of hyperbolic images most often linked to white-privilege and wealthy communities’ lifestyles: Migos, Versace, Youtube, uploaded by Migos ATL, October 1, 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"><sup>54</sup></span>.<br>
              Among this different array of styles, however, fictionalization has been historically predominant, far surpassing the documentary style, which instead

           – and which only today is seeing a resurgence thanks to a community of creators and curators,
            like COMPLEX (US) or YARD (FR), producing video tours of influential neighbourhoods within rap culture.<br>
              Since the early days of the genre, in fact, especially with the rise of gangsta rap, rappers have often worked with the movie industry in the production
           of soundtracks or taking acting roles 
           <span class="hovertext" data-hover="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001084/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"><sup>56</sup></span>

           (1999). And over the years, this phenomenon has done nothing but spread, consolidating the relationship between rap music and film culture; a relationship that kept
             on influencing rappers’ ambitions and rap videos’ accounts on the urban experience, both in and out of the North American context.<br><br>
          A case in point is Gomorrah

           (2008 -2010), the initiative had a great appeal to local rap scenes, which started leaving behind American icons and
            instead embrace  the European ones.<br>
              Fascinated by Gomorrah storyline and characters, several French rappers, for instance, picked Scampia as additional location for their videos,
           such as PNL in Le monde ou rien 
           <span class="hovertext" data-hover="PNL, Le monde ou rien, YouTube, uploaded by PNL, June 12, 2015, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umF1kfVujhM"><sup>69</sup></span>

            and encountered only on screen, suddenly epitomized their life stories and ambitions, as much as their hometowns.<br><br>
          However, whilst acknowledging the usefulness and therapeutic value of using ‘ready-made’ narratives and imageries taken from films and TV series,
           over the years the use of movie references in rap videos, especially crime drama, has led to a stereotypification and calcification of the genre
            iconography, which now is flattened more and more by over-banalized images

              On the contrary, less ‘cinematic’ videos, synthesizing their own imagery according to the habits and customs of each neighborhood, kept on
           constructing ever-evolving scenarios and expressive scenes.<br>
              For instance, keeping an eye on Scampia, this time from a different angle, the representation of the area given by Co’ sang in Int'o Rione 
          <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Cosang, Int'o Rione, YouTube, uploaded by cosang, March 31, 2006, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXZDRkDx-Q8"><sup>72</sup></span>

          The list of locations is in fact, extremely coherent and well-curated, giving the impression that the landscape doesn’t change much, except for 
          local landmarks; that daily routines do not change, although seen in different contexts. One homogeneous geography, made of suburbs inhabited only by loud 
          and resentful men sharing the same lifestyle. However, as apocalyptic as it may seem, by acknowledging similarities in different urban contexts, and through 
          a highly selective take on reality, Sofiane is able to bring the European urban periphery and its social divide into focus; and potentially speak to an audience 
          that identifies itself with it, perhaps living in urban areas under the same or transposable conditions depicted in his videos. <br><br>

          <p class="p-shifted"><em>Blanc-Mesnil, Aulnay, Sevran, Bondy, La Courneuve, all these places, we know each other, we are in the same delirium.</em></p><br>
          Indeed, what he calls “le même délire” is nothing but a reference to the aftermath of a mismanaged urbanization process and its impact on urban communities 
          now living under a regime of formal and informal segregation, impoverishment, and abuse; a condition which on the other hand, has also allowed rap culture 
          to create a sense of community, and which has granted to the genre an influential status in urban contexts; opening up a chance for the genre to become a 
          public platform against a hegemonic conception of France's urban identity. <br><br>
          <p class="p-shifted"><em>I think there is a “common” that grows stronger and stronger. We always have to create institutions! But creating institutions 
            also means creating forms of cities, because an institution is not a metaphysical representation or an ideal archetype! It is among other, concrete 
            forms that the city has to be constructed, that the metropolis can constitute the common. And it goes without saying that I am not only speaking here of 
            buildings! There are, of course, buildings, but there is also communication — the lines, the spaces, and so forth. Creating an institution means creating 
            a public space. [...] Because we still require a place in which this multitude will exist — not only a network through which it communicates, but also the 
            power to decide its living conditions. This power to decide plays a role in developing a relationship between the multitude and state structures or 
            institutions, and from a negative perspective this means an uproar; from a constructive perspective it means revolution.

          However, despite the multiethnic French banlieue has become a space from which French rap culture could potentially challenge the representation of Frenchness, 
          interrogate universalist notions of citizenship, encourage discussions on otherness, and open up a possibility of reclaiming  the urban space, on the other hand, 
          most videos seem to exist in a social vacuum where there are no actual possibilities of exchange or encounters within segments of the community, unless it's 
          between small, demographically homogeneous circles of people. <br>
              Indeed, Sofiane’s videos, as many others, show us the cité within an extremely narrow framework, presenting it as a self-enclosed world, in which the 
          hyper-masculine focus on the aforementioned elements neglects the off-screen everyday life animating the suburb, reinforcing the gap between the multi-layered 
          reality of the banlieue, and its mythological and catastrophic representation by TV programs

            We have fun here, we make barbecue. We put 5€ each and we make a big barbecue for everyone. We do everything, we borrow trucks to take the little ones to

          Paradoxically, even when rap culture claims to counter conservative conceptions of the urban periphery, when it takes on the task of portraying its 
          surroundings, that same hegemonic and catastrophic representation seems to remain in place. <br>
              Indeed, as far as the genre drifted away from American film culture and built its own local imagery, its process of assimilating and understanding the 
          environment seems still to rely on other dominant narratives, ending up recycling and reinforcing – in a different visual style – a deeply ingrained set of 
          images; raising the question of whether rappers have somehow internalized pre-existing media representations, then unconsciously reproduced, or whether 
          their hyper-masculine and universalist claims about banlieue lifestyles are to be intended as a form of legitimization, which attempts to mediate economic, 
          social and political disenfranchisement. <br><br>
          What is certain is that rap video culture has developed the scale and the non-gimmicky potential to heighten public awareness around contemporary urban 
          issues, and become a counterpart to hegemonic discourses about urban outcasts. But in order to do so,the genre needs to stop dealing with dispossession in a 
          one-dimensional way, and break the cycle of canonical rap imageries; starting from getting away from models of exclusion and opening itself to segments of the 
          community long disregarded and often kept outside of the frame, unless it was by accident. <br>

           argues that we need to learn how to renew our habits of assembly and recognize that we're part of a 
          common project, and this is exactly the only way rap culture can sustainably evolve and have the capacity to be relevant to more than a few listeners; 
          becoming the legitimate soundtrack of contemporary urban peripheries.<br><br>
